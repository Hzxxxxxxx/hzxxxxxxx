Good documentation, readable code, great performance, intuitive APIs. These are few things that differentiates a successful open source project than just another GitHub repo that nobody cares. But what if you've done all that and still nobody is paying attention?

Unless you’re a rockstar developer or a well-known company, you’ll need to promote your new thing. I know, I know, you're an engineer, "promoting" is a curse word for you. Well, I'm sorry to tell you that but "build it and they will come" [doesn't work these days](http://www.quora.com/Why-is-If-you-build-it-they-will-come-terrible-advice).

Driven by my endless curiosity on to [how to measure developer relations success](http://www.quora.com/How-do-you-measure-success-in-developer-relations), I did some data mining to find out how the answer. Let's explore two relevant open source projects from two big players in the tech industry.
